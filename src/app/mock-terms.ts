Certificates of Deposit - Certificates of deposit are a type of savings account which holds a certain amount of money for a fixed amount of time.  During this time, the money accumulates interest, and at the end the bank pays out both the money is the account and the interest gained. CD can only be bought through a federally insured bank, which are insured for up to $250,000.  As a result CDs are considered some of the safest forms of investment.
Hedge Funds - Similar to a mutual fund, hedge funds pool money from investors, and diversifies investments across multiple stocks and bonds.  Hedge funds are less regulated and therefore can make riskier investments than a mutual fund.  As a result those who invest in hedge funds are wealthier investors who can afford to take that risk, unlike mutual funds, which are open to nearly everyone.
